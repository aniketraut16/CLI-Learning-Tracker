### Project Outline: CLI Learning Tracker

#### Features:

1. **Add Learning Topics**: Add topics you’re currently studying, such as “TypeScript,” “React,” “Blockchain,” etc.
2. **Set Learning Goals**: Set specific goals for each topic, like “Finish TypeScript course,” “Build a React project,” or “Learn Next.js basics.”
3. **Log Progress**: Update each topic with daily or weekly progress, such as completed modules, hours spent, or milestones achieved.
4. **View Summary**: Display your progress with details on each topic, including completion percentage, hours logged, and a timeline.
5. **Analyze Learning Trends**: Show a summary of which topics you’ve dedicated the most time to, areas where you’re behind, and topics where you’re on track.

#### Key TypeScript Concepts to Practice:

- **Custom Types and Interfaces**: Define types for `Topic`, `Goal`, `ProgressLog`, etc.
- **Typed Arrays**: Use typed arrays to store multiple topics and logs.
- **Union and Literal Types**: Handle various learning states, such as `in-progress`, `completed`, and `pending`.
- **Utility Types**: Use `Pick` or `Partial` to edit goals or add progress updates without affecting other properties.
- **Generics**: Build reusable functions for updating logs or calculating completion percentages.
- **Optional Properties**: Use optional properties for fields like `deadline` or `priority`.

#### Additional Features:

- **Data Persistence**: Save learning topics and progress to a file, so it’s easy to review later.
- **Statistics and Visualization**: Display progress bars or charts (e.g., percentage complete for each topic).
- **Topic Reminders**: Add reminders for goals that are close to deadlines or need urgent attention.

### Example Usage:

- **Add Topic**: `Add new topic "Learn TypeScript"`
- **Set Goal**: `Set goal for "TypeScript" - "Complete TypeScript Handbook"`
- **Log Progress**: `Update "TypeScript" progress - "Watched 2 hours of video, completed chapter 3"`
- **View Summary**: View all topics, time logged, and completion status.

This tool could act as your personalized learning dashboard, helping you stay consistent and motivated with all your self-learning goals. Plus, as you progress, you’ll have a record of all the new skills and topics you’ve tackled!
